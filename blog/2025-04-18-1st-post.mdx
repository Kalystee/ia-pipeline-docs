## Welcome to my first post on IA-Pipeline project

The goal of this project (if I can work ion it more than a day) is to automatize the deployment process by giving the minimum info from the user

The target objectives are :

- Explore the usage of AI (generative and advanced agent )
- Adaption of environment (based on training)
- Easy to deploy and train
- Make the deployment process evolve by himself without touching the code
- Save time üï∞Ô∏è


### Tools

As a generative AI, I will try to user **Le Chat** from Mistral AI. After few tests, it generates decent output for the first step
So it should be ok for a starting solution / POC

I will focus on GithubActions image build and deployment as it is simple and free
So, I would like to see how the agent handle the change of actions and adapt to the "pipeline" of a GitHub organization

For the infra part, I need to check the solutions, I think Heroku is good to start, but it is maybe too simple
I will see later for this part


### Next Target

My first tasks (after publishing this) will be to :

- Create a custom generative agent in Le Chat that create a generic GitHub Action (GA) from a simple prompt
- Retrieve the content and save it in the matching project on GitHub
- Processing the GA to build the project

ETA: End of July


Have fun !
